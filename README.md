# Mise en Place
This repo contains a script for my computational mise en place. The name of
this repo is in regards to everything needing to be in place before I begin my
computational cooking. It's also a tongue-in-cheek reference to my inability to
work without my dotfiles/system being in perfect working order. Hence my
aptitude for procrastination since I assume they are never in working order. 

To install my system, simply run the following in terminal
```{bash}
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordans1882/autorice_script/master/autorice.sh
bash autorice.sh
rm autorice.sh
```

# TODO
Some things I would like to do for future implementations
 - Generalize to other distributions (In case of fascists)
