# Auto-rice scripts
This repo contains a script to auto-rice a new Arch based linux machine

To install the system, simply run the following in terminal
```{bash}
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordans1882/autorice_script/master/autorice.sh
bash autorice.sh
rm autorice.sh
```

# TODO
Some things I would like to do for future implementations
 - Generalize to other distributions (In case of fascists)
